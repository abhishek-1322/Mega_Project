Today i worked on:

1) Solved program to find all the divisors of a number using brute force and optimal approaches.
2) Solved problem statement: Given two integers N1 and N2, find their greatest common divisor using optimal approaches.
3) Solved problem statement: Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.
4) Solved problem statement: Given an integer N, return true it is an Armstrong number otherwise return false.
5) Solved problem statement: Given an integer N, check whether it is prime or not. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself and the total number of divisors is 2.
6) Working on coding standards & learn how to use mongodb pre hooks & methods in schema.
